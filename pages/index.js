                    My current focus is on improving my full stack development skills. As of now, I have learned and implemented ReactJs into my 
                    senior design project and have worked with Predix.io and IBM Cloud. I am currently invested in doing side projects on my 
                    personal time, learning frameworks and libraries such as NextJs and Redux. Aside from programming, I enjoy music, dogs üê∂, music concerts, 
                    pizza üçï, movies.
